1. Is there a clear strategy to differentiate between structural mech-
anisms (e.g., forward-looking behavior) from unobserved heterogeneity (e.g., heterogeneous
preferences)?
I don't understand what it means by differentiate? if we do not allow for unobserved type what would be the estimation outcome? or what does it want to get?
