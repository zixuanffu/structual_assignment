## Essay

2. Write the simplest version of the model in the paper that captures the main mechanisms that the paper is interested in. What are the theoretical predictions of the model? Does it have empirically testable implications?
3. Discuss the role of unobserved heterogeneity in the model. Does the baseline model allow for unobserved heterogeneity? Is there a clear strategy to differentiate between structural mechanisms (e.g., forward-looking behavior) from unobserved heterogeneity (e.g., heterogeneous preferences)? Can the model be nested in any of the frameworks we have studied?
Suggestions on simplifying models:
- Can the number of periods in the model be reduced? (e.g., rather than a full life-cycle model, could you start with a two period model for (young / old)?)
- What is the minimal set of variables that can capture the essential mechanisms of the model?
- Is there a low dimensional, fully discrete version of the model that captures the mechanism of the model? (e.g., can you simplify to high/low income?)

## Presentation
- explain the minimal version of model in the paper
- the identification challenges associated with the model.
